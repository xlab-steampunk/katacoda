Hello and welcome to Steampunk's Modern Ansible Introduction!

In this scenario, we will play around with Ansible, focusing on commands and
constructs that are as future-proof as possible.

We will start by analyzing a small Ansible playbook and explaining the purpose
of its components, continue with discussing the Ansible inventory, and
conclude our escapade with some custom Ansible content installation.

Ready, set, go!
